## Usage

### Script Tag

Add the following code towards the end of the `head` section on your page and replace `<app-id>` with your app id at the end of the script.

```html
<script>
    !function(e,n,t,r){
        function o(){try{var e;if((e="string"==typeof this.response?JSON.parse(this.response):this.response).url){var t=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],r=n.createElement("script");r.async=!0,r.src=e.url,t.parentNode.insertBefore(r,t)}}catch(e){}}var s,p,a,i=[],c=[];e[t]={init:function(){s=arguments;var e={then:function(n){return c.push({type:"t",next:n}),e},catch:function(n){return c.push({type:"c",next:n}),e}};return e},on:function(){i.push(arguments)},render:function(){p=arguments},destroy:function(){a=arguments}},e.__onWebMessengerHostReady__=function(n){if(delete e.__onWebMessengerHostReady__,e[t]=n,s)for(var r=n.init.apply(n,s),o=0;o<c.length;o++){var u=c[o];r="t"===u.type?r.then(u.next):r.catch(u.next)}p&&n.render.apply(n,p),a&&n.destroy.apply(n,a);for(o=0;o<i.length;o++)n.on.apply(n,i[o])};var u=new XMLHttpRequest;u.addEventListener("load",o),u.open("GET","https://"+r+".webloader.smooch.io/",!0),u.responseType="json",u.send()
    }(window,document,"Smooch","<app-id>");
</script>
```

then initialize the Web Messenger by placing this snippet towards the end of the `body` section of your page.

<script>
    Smooch.init({appId: '<app-id>'});
</script>
```

## API

### Individual functions

#### init(options)
Initializes the Smooch widget in the web page using the specified options. It returns a promise that will resolve when the Web Messenger is ready. Note that except`on` and `off`, all methods needs to be called after a successful `init`.

##### Options

| Option | Optional? | Default value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| appId | No | - | Your app id |
| jwt | Yes | - | Token to authenticate your communication with the server (see http://docs.smooch.io/javascript/#authenticating-users-optional)
| userId | Yes | - | User's id |
| soundNotificationEnabled | Yes | `true` | Enables the sound notification for new messages |
| imageUploadEnabled | Yes | `true` | Enables the image upload feature. |
| embedded | Yes | False | Tells the widget it will be embedded. (see Embedded section below) |
| customText | Yes | See the example below | Strings used in the widget UI. You can use these to either customize the text or translate it. If something is between `{}`, it's a variable and needs to stay in your customized text if you want to use it. |

```javascript
var skPromise = Smooch.init({
    appId: '<app-id>',

});


skPromise.then(function() {
    // do something
});

// pass it around...

skPromise.then(function() {
    //do something else
});

```

#### open()
Opens the conversation widget (noop when embedded)

```javascript
Smooch.open();
```

#### close()
Closes the conversation widget (noop when embedded)

```javascript
Smooch.close();
```

#### isOpened()
Tells if the widget is currently opened or closed.

```javascript
Smooch.isOpened();
```

#### login(userId , jwt)
Logs a user in the Web Messenger, retrieving the conversation the user already had on other browsers and/or devices. Note that you don't need to call this after `init` if you passed the user id and jwt already, it's done internally. This returns a promise that resolves when the Web Messenger is ready again.

```
Smooch.login('some-id', 'some-jwt');
```

#### logout()
Logs out the current user and reinitialize the widget with an anonymous user. This returns a promise that resolves when the Web Messenger is ready again.

```
Smooch.logout();
```

#### destroy()
Destroys the Web Messenger and makes it disappear. The Web Messenger has to be reinitialized with `init` to be working again because it also clears up the app id from the Web Messenger. It will also unbind all listeners you might have with `Smooch.on`.

```
Smooch.destroy();
```

#### sendMessage(message)
Sends a message on the user's behalf

```javascript
Smooch.sendMessage({
    type: 'text',
    text: 'hello'
});

// OR

Smooch.sendMessage('hello');
```

#### updateUser(user)
Updates user information

```javascript
Smooch.updateUser({
    givenName: 'Updated',
    surname: 'Name',
    email: 'updated@email.com',
    properties: {
      'justGotUpdated': true
    }
});
```

#### getUser()
Returns the current user.

```javascript
var user = Smooch.getUser()
```

#### getConversation()
Returns the conversation if it exists

```javascript
var conversation = Smooch.getConversation();
```

### Events
If you want to make sure your events are triggered, try to bind them before calling `Smooch.init`.

To bind an event, use `Smooch.on(<event name>, <handler>);`. To unbind events, you can either call `Smooch.off(<event name>, handler)` to remove one specific handler, call `Smooch.off(<event name>)` to remove all handlers for an event, or call `Smooch.off()` to unbind all handlers.

#### ready
```
// This event triggers when init completes successfully... Be sure to bind before calling init!
Smooch.on('ready', function(){
    console.log('the init has completed!');
});

Smooch.init(...);
```

#### destroy
```
// This event triggers when the widget is destroyed.
Smooch.on('destroy', function(){
    console.log('the widget is destroyed!');
});

Smooch.destroy();
```

#### message:received
```
// This event triggers when the user receives a message
Smooch.on('message:received', function(message) {
    console.log('the user received a message', message);
});
```

#### message:sent
```
// This event triggers when the user sends a message
Smooch.on('message:sent', function(message) {
    console.log('the user sent a message', message);
});
```

#### message
```
// This event triggers when a message was added to the conversation
Smooch.on('message', function(message) {
    console.log('a message was added to the conversation', message);
});
```

#### unreadCount
```
// This event triggers when the number of unread messages changes
Smooch.on('unreadCount', function(unreadCount) {
    console.log('the number of unread messages was updated', unreadCount);
});
```

#### widget:opened
```
// This event triggers when the widget is opened
Smooch.on('widget:opened', function() {
    console.log('Widget is opened!');
});
```

#### widget:closed
```
// This event triggers when the widget is closed
Smooch.on('widget:closed', function() {
    console.log('Widget is closed!');
});
```

### Embedded mode
As describe above, to activate the embedded mode, you need to pass `embedded: true` when calling `Smooch.init`. By doing so, you are disabling the auto-rendering mechanism and you will need to call `Smooch.render` manually. This method accepts a DOM element which will be used as the container where the widget will be rendered.

The embedded widget will take full width and height of the container. You must give it a height, otherwise, the widget will collapse.

## How to contribute

### Clone the git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/smooch/smooch-js
```

### Install Node.js and run the following

```
npm install
```

In one console, run `npm run dev` to start the web server.

Then, go to `http://localhost:8282` to test the normal widget or `http://localhost:8282/embedded` for the embedded one.
