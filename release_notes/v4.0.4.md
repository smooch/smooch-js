# What's changed?
- Fixed a bug where the appUser would sometimes not be updated on message send.
- `getUser()` now returns any pending user properties that are waiting to be sent the to server due to the debounce mechanism around user updates.
- Pending user properties will now be sent to the server right before a user is logged in to make sure to not lose them in the process.
